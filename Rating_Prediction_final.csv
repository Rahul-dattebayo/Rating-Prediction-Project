I am writing with a deep grief that just a 15 days to purchase that phone. Phone is not getting started. Phone battery was drained.. when I plug in the power cord with the phone. It is not even started even after charging for an hour.. This is not good for a reputable brand and it happened with the new phone just a 15 days old. What can I do with it.. my all happiness went in sadness..,2
"Best for pubg I can play pubg without any lag in this 3gb model Iove this phone and the battery will last for me if iam playing a whole day pubg , them when I go to the bed the charge will be minimam above 20%.

Here are the pros and cons for each KPI:
Built quality: Excellent i would say no hiccups while using although it carries polycarbonate back.
Display: Colour reproduction is best in its class, cant be compared to OLED but it just does the job done.
Performance: Tried couple of intensive and mid games namely Asphalt, Marvel Champion's. Both games were supported but longer sessions made mobile reach higher temperatures. Casual gaming is okay!

Even it has 3 GB ram, it act as 2 GB.

Buy a tempered glass, it will help protect the screen. Weight is very light and aspect ratio is nice. Battery is just awesome.


Buy this if you are a light user with occasional gaming like Free Fire or PUBG (both lite gamers) and emulation games. It could run upto NDS ...",5

"Its a good product form poco. For non heavy application users this phone is simply perfect. Has ample amount of storage, decent amount of RAM, good quality camera.
The only disadvantage is it doesnt have any finger unlock system. to unlock you have pattern and pin options. This could have been an added feature for this range of money.
The processor is also decent but will have frame drops when playing heavy games.
Overall the phone is good for daily use but bad for heavy application usage.",5

"Phone is heavy. That's okay but it is big. That's one problem. Doesn't fit in palm for those who have smaller grips. Phone is slow. At this price point I must not expect very much, but I felt it's slow even in basic processes, like unlocking, YouTube opening camera and other basic app opening. I think this is slightly overpriced. At this price fingerprint should have come. Battery is very good. Overall it will be good for people who don't do much except normal usage.",3

- Battery backup is amazing.
- Using this phone as spare phone from one and half months. Didn't faced any heating or lagging issue till now.",5

"Overall Good budget phone

One thing needs to be fixed on exchange :

When we exchange new phone and value of old phone is finalised at the time of checks from the pickup person the amount difference needs to be updated on the Flipkart app as well so that I will be more clear to customer about what amount needs to be exactly paid while exchange",3
"has a lot of bloatwares(about 20+) enough to use more than 1GB OF 3GB RAM and internal storage 32gb is used upto 11.5gb by the system and preloaded apps,not much of a battery performance or the phone drains the battery faster(97 to 48 in 2hrs-->only read pdf files),camera poor,screen good,lag free (not tested with high end gaming )..hmm if micromax 1b is available for your pincode buy it(not available for me)..micromax 1b is superior to other 7000 range phones..believe me i have done my resea...",3

"Decent product! Poco C3 3gb, 32gb device. Purchased for 6299/-
Purchased it for mother and I am happy with the product. Dont expect too much at this price range. Functioning is smooth with regular apps, display in indoor conditions is good, should have littile more brighter for visibility in daylight condition. Battery performance is good, however take 2.5 to 3Hrs to full charge. Camera is good in daylight but not in night or in darkness. Build quality is plastic but feel premium one.

Writing review after one month. Camera is good, touch is fine, Mobile is value for money, but facing heating issue. Sometime it becomes too much hot! I thought after software upgradation it will be fix but I was wrong, and if you are going for exchange, think wisely, Flipkart deducted 1000 of my exchange amount just for a very little small spot, which you have to find through magnifying glass!",2

Look : The design of the phone is quite attractive with a different back camera panel having a logo ""poco"" of the company. Body colour texture is excellent. It looks quite premium product. With a plastic back cover, there will be no fingerprint stick with your phone. Although, due to high capacity battery, you may feel little bit heavy on you...",5

"This is my geniune review with POCO M3.
Basically I am a one plus 8 User and purchased M3 Just for its design. I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.

first of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.
My honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.

As mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.

Display is really good in this price segment....",5
"It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable. Front camera not upto the mark and back camera is better as this price range. Miui 12 is buggy and still needs updates for stability.

Nothing is great. Can't have a Google feed normally also.

"The phone looks like very good and also i liked the MI Launcher very much. But, other thinks are average.

I didn't expect this type of camera, camera is very poor...

The phone Heating is a big problem and also charger.
When you plugged the charger for 1hour the heating of the charger looks like, you charged the charger for 10hour. Charger and phone heating is not normal..

I tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3",3

Respected buyers mobile outlook was fantastic , but if u want good camera quality don't buy these mobile..
Camera quality was too low
Don't buy if u look good camera mobile",3
"POCO M3 is good phone but it have a very cheapest display the colors of display is very bad many times its display gave the some issues. It is not even good for childrens.

The processor ram and camera is very good but display is very bad some time i touch any appp and its open other app",1
"If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).
This phone has the worst selfie camera

The good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.
A 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button",2

Why?
1-It heat up while charging and playing games
2- Phone sensitive very less
3- there's no hands free call in game turbo so it's a pain in the neck when call came while playing games

6- battery never last as how it mention in the specification (4000 mah is better )and to fully charge it took almost 4 hou...",1
"I find it very suitable for my needs and give me value for money. As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.

Con:

1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.
2. The earpiece from where the sound comes out while talking over phone is not that loud. You have to use headphone for clear voices.",4

"Two biggest cons:-
1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.
2) Camera is pathetic.

PROS:-
1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.
2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.

I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.
If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.
If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.

Gaming - not for using high gaming.",4

"Using Poco m3 for the past two months. It's a very good phone at this price range. The stock camera app is not so great. I suggest you to use Google cam, It can produce great results. Camera quality is very good when capturing photos using gcam. Battery will last more than 10hrs screen on time on normal usage. Performance wise also good. Value for money 💰",5

The primary cam is fairly good but the edge detection is poor coming to human subjects. Overall, this phone is a good option if you a kind of lite user.",3

Overall satisfied, fulfilling the requirement very well.
About review is based on one month usage.",5

Phone is running nice. But the processor should be better like Mi phones. Battery life is satisfactory. Camera is good in pro mode. But no front flash for selfie. White screen light is all for selfie. Overall it is a good product.,4

Thanks flipkart for delivering it on time at this tough Covid times.,5
It is good budget mobile but the camera performance is not upto the mark. We can't expect 48 mp camera as a good quality more over battery is so good and display was good where we can't find a better than this phone like this in this budget.,3

"Felling awesome.

Thanks flipkart. I received this mobile for 10k and before 24 hour's deliver, really too good and fully satisfied.
Really too much worth mobile. It's is genuine feedback.
After using few days, I'm going to give feedback.

Concerns: finger print,
Mobile weight
No rich look.
Back up is too worest, they given 64GB storage.

Pro's: performance,
Camera quality back side just ok.
Battery backup more than 48 hours.

Finally review is too good, really too worthy mobile.",5
"I am not a gamer, so I know nothing about gaming performance. But the performance is so far so good when it comes to battery life. It's definitely a game player at this price with such battery back up. Coming to the cameras, I think they are decent and value for money. There are minor lags and may be it is because of MI's aggressive RAM management. At times, I felt that the touch calibration is not accurate enough. However that may change with the user. And when it comes to heating I haven't ...",5
I think it's a good one in it's range. I don't know how it's working coz I've gifted to my cousin. However after a great research I've ordered as 3 of my friends using it from a long...... Thanks to flipkart for ur supercoins.,4
"I use this phone since 5 days front camera not good after all features best like battery, rear camera very fine",4
"I am using this phone from past 11 days till now I am very much satisfied with its performance and battery life, I can play all games like free fire, pubG, COD without any lag it's only gets warm during playing COD, I am most happy with its battery, when I use it for normal use like whatsapp, fb, phone call, music, I can use it for 48hrs and if gaming and all then it's like 18 hrs. Moral of the story is I am very much Satisfied.",5
"Awesome product. I have been using the device for three days; satisfactory camera quality, processing speed is mind blowing, games mostly run at High settings, awesome display, breathtaking stereo sound from the loud built in speakers, good connectivity, no such issues with privacy. Comes with minimum bloatware which could be uninstalled.
Over all a Value for Money Product. I got it for INR 8,100. According to the price tag and my preferences it is the Best smartphone available.",5
"It is okay but a huge improvement should be done basic feauters like call recording is missing... Litlle bit lazy in processing, camera is also not good as compared to mobiles of this price range included both front and rear. Has dual speakers but the second speaker is of no use as it has very low volume level and sometimes while playing audio main speaker collapse and only 2nd top speaker gives audio with a very low volume dont know why it is then we have to restart it",3
"the phone is very good at this rate for daily use it is best phone in this rate, about its camera descent quality in this rate , but still some issue .
phones battery is monster. its soooo amazing I really love it . but its charging time it took is too much, but its a big battery so its ok .
its good for gaming but about pubg its not much good . gyro didn't work probably its the only problem I face and all the phone is awesome.",5
"Mobile is absolutely fantastic and is best to buy if one's budget within 11k, overall performance is good along with a good battery life makes it really worth purchasing.",5
"Bought it for 11.5k including insurance.

Battery is awesome. 12 hrs of screen on time
Processor is good enough for Multi tasking day to day tasks
6 gb ram and ufs 2.2 will make things very smooth actually
Not much for gaming heavy games
Camera is decent for this price point
UI is shiitt . Typical MIUI.
So using other launcher
Looks are really good and build quality is top notch at this price range.
Dual speakers are very good
No heating issues
4.5/5 for this price range.
Go for it",5
In this range we got this phone is really amazing performance and some features are really satisfied thank you flipkart for this awesome product,5
"I like to flipkart. Am like mobile better than flipkart service. Like delivary, customer care , nd technecian everyone. Thank you to flipkart. I hate mobile camera only. Am very disappointed for that...",3
"I was in the lookout for a good phone for my father and thankfully I came to know about this product through one of my friend. Poco M3 was a good buy.

I have to admit, the camera even though its 48megapixel, I'm not sure if it does the job properly as the quality of the image is under par !

The varient that I bought for my dad was the 6gb + 128 gb and I must say this is a very smooth transition for him considering his old phone. The battery life is awesome, on an average my dad can use hi...",5
"The Poco M3 is more than just its premium looks. It offers much more for an affordable price point including excellent battery life, decent performance, 6GB RAM, a crisp FHD+ display, and a stereo speaker setup. It is a great option to consider under 15K, especially for users that are scouring the market for a smartphone not only performs well but also looks great.",5
I am using this phone from last 7 days and the one thing I notice js battery performance it's excellent I am totally satisfied with the battery. Although I faced lag sometimes due to MIUI 12 and also the camera is not upto the mark there is an camera update needed here but the speaker and display quality is best in segment. 6 GB ram and the looks of this phone is very strong point for buying. As per my experience this is the best phone one can have and everyone should go for it if your budget...,5
Overall the review of the phone is quite good and I want to say that I liked it quite well for that I want to add that the camera must provide a very good performance and after that ok it is good it is best for me because I have paid nearly 12000 rupees and the product is very very greater than worth it,5
"Everything is good, good battery, amazing display, value for money processor and it's a very good phone for day to day use (except gaming) and final about camera is rear camera is price worthy but front camera is not good in night with low light (single bulb) so if you want to enjoy online content on it gooooo for it but not for gaming at High or selfie",4
"Nice quality products
Performance average as it is an stock android
Battery backup nice i like it
Display a little more than average
Camera not so gud of front but the rear camera is gud for sure
Overall at the price value it is a decent product",4
"I bought this phone same day on it's launched in India. It's a good mobile with fast charging and brilliant battery backup.. Camera quality is fine, it has automatic filter in the front camera which I don't like. It gets hot fast while playing games so it is good that I'm not a games lover, however, my kids play games on it and I keeps worrying of them... I have given 4 stars because battery backup and fast charging was the priority.",4
"Battery backup is very good but charging is very slow I think company are cheating us to show fast charging option is available with it.
Rear camera is average but front camera is not upto expectations.
Operating performances is good no heating issue observed.
Weight is slightly higher sound quality and loudness is just average.
Instead of soft case if provided headphone with it shall be better.
Overall I will give rating for battery backup 5/5, charging-1/5, camera quality- 3/5, sound...",3
"The phone has very good storage, good features, good audio, but the camera is a little low. And the best in all respects.",4

Display quality is good but brightness is not at all enough

Reviewing after 1 month of use. 5 star for battery backup 6000 mah batter fulfill your all gaming & operational requirement. 6GB RAM is amazing at this price. Camera quality is average to good. It's basically gaming & operation purpose phone. For camera centric people may be go with higher variant,5

It's so good👍,5

"Got the mobile for 10K.
Good phone for its budget.

Ear piece quality could have been better.
Worst camera. (front and rear).
No ADs in the UI. (Note: I disabled all the checkboxes while setting up the mobile for the first time)",4
All's good about the phone except the fact that the wifi antenna is not great. My older phone used to detect wifi signals from the hall without a glitch but this one finds it hard to detect. Also the connection keeps defaulting to mobile data and you have to manually switch it back to wifi. Tried all the settings but still the problem persists.,4
Good quality,5
Except front cam and as it is 6000mah battery I expected good battery life but did not reach expectations remaining everything is awesome and absolute product for money,4
"best sound quality

Gifted this to my mom. She loved it.,5
"The device is good in this price segment, what I personally fee, is the charger, that came in the box, is not so okay, as when I charge the phone with my old charger (POCO F1), the charging time is significantly low, it takes 70-80minutes to charge the phone from 10%-90%, however, when I use the in box charger, it takes 120-130 minutes for the same, other than that, everything is good.",4
Good budget phone,4
"Horrible. I got this phone because Poco claims to give ""clean experience"", ads free experience. Thats what stands it out from competitors. But after 4-5 months, it now frequently shows ads...... I've tried everything, but ads won't stop popping up! Shame on you Poco for fake claims!",1

If you are a normal user and play minimalistic games this phone is definitely for you.

And as the company says it is packed with a powerful 2day battery (for normal use). Or you will drain approx 10 to 12% charge in 1hour.

Everybody says that the camera is very bad..... Actually it is not the camera which is bad it's the application....... You can get superb photos with a Gcam while the selfie camera will surprise you for sure.",5

Recovery mode reboot did not work had to wipe all the data from the phone to restart it and then it started working... Had to redo entire setup again dont knw how many times this will have to be repeated... A very bad quality product if the updates are not tested on each n every device they should not be released to end users,1

Don't buy this phone. If you switch off then try to on or reboot you've to do factory data reset. Customer care also very unhelpful. Problem not only on my mobile but also I'm 3 others Poco M3 sets that my friends bought alongside me.,2
There is problem for watsapp voice message.not hearing and viewing its playing message,1
"A little improvement I camera.
Other wise a very good phone.",4
MIUI is pathetic. It requires multiple clicks to get the touch function. Too many ads and pop up. Phone built is very good. Camara is ok. Don't expect too much. I suggest go for realme device in the same price range to get value for money,3

POCO M3 is the best budget all rounder smartphone priced under 12000 rupees. No other brand is providing such value for money products as compared to POCO.

Design is good but that big POCO logo is killing the beauty.It feels so cheap lol.Also these all good features are of no use if you have software issues like i said the OS/UI is very very bad.

Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..,5
As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent 🙂,4
Quality wise good. Good performance of the prize. Cam quality was good what ever it as simply awsome.. 😇😘,4
I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance 😊,5
I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart 💝🙃😘,5
"What else do one expects in this price range? Hm... Best in its segment literally, talking about cameras, battery, performance, display and everything else (including Xiaomi MiUi) bestest ever! It's my daddy's smartphone, he'd be greatly using it... I do recommend to go for it, it's just awesome. Here are some shots and a ss for authentication, yes go for it! It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!",5
"After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image.
During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality.
Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.",4
I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good 👍👍 display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.,4
Nice phone iba very happy camer is good I like it Redmi 9 power,5
"Writing my reviews after 4 days of use.
Pros.
1. Side mounted finger senser, it works well.
2. Battery backup is good, easily lasts for a day.
3. Fast charging, works well
Cons.
1. Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP.
INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good.
Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone.
I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back

I needed a budge...",3
"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if
having-
Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera.
Procesor: Slightly lower

But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product.",4
I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.,5
"Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you
Battery is like 4000 mh
And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10",4
"May Be Best Pocket Friendly Phone Under 10-15K
Gaming Experience Is Smooth As Amul Butter.
camera Good, Portrait Mode Is Awesome",5
"At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device...
I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.",5
"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price.",3
"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days.
My opinion

FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.

BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..

Display : display looks clear & very good

Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing

Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..


Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10",5
"Review after 2months.
Budget phone.
In this price specification is good.
Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good.
Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged.
Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average.
Selfi camera is not good.
Body is plastic fiber so is good.
Design is awesome.
Performance wise is ok.
Rating:out of 5star
Camera : ⭐⭐
Battery :⭐⭐⭐⭐
Performance:⭐⭐⭐
Design:⭐⭐⭐⭐
Procesor:⭐⭐⭐⭐",3
"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!",5
"It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent
Over all it's a good phone at the price",5
"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you 😊",5
"Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item.
Thanks.",5
"This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.

But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.

And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.

My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.",3
Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.,5
"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good.",5
"1. Notifications LED is not available.
2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)",5
"It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support
18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops
But after the update the problem is solved",5
Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone,4
The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.,5
Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it,5
"Fiery red colour is excellent
Battery backup is also very good
Camera quality is best
Phone was slim and light weight
Value for money",4
"Nice phone in correct price..
U should also try this phone
Good quality of display and battery but something is missing like front flashlight",3
"Its quite good, but camera has got quite sharpness, battery is good, display is like ok, well overall gives good performance with good chipset.",4
Performance is very good and battery is quickly charging and this battery is available upto 24 hours only and camera performance is not equal to 48mega pixel. If you want to good camera please don't buy this mobile. This mobile is very weight for me. Display is good.,3
"It is a very good phone with good features at this price point. The camera is good for this price point, processor is also good, and battery is superb. This phone is made for the daily normal usage and not very heavy games and the phone works very smooth with normal and daily use.",5
"It's a decent phone I'm writing this review after the 2 days of use. Everything is good. When I ordered I was slightly concerned about the big branding at the back side but after putting the case on ( which was inside the box) it looks good and the branding doesn't feel like it's there.
I don't play games so can't say much about gaming experience, but in regular uses this is really smooth.
No ads till now. I think it is best at this price point.",5
"Power packed performance, absolutely loved it!! Initially I had a confusion in choosing this phone. Finally i zeroed my search to samsung F11 and Redmi Power: But now I realise that my choice is right about Redmi 9 Power⚡⚡⚡⚡ Thanks flipkart for one time delivery!!

I was using redmi note 5 before i buy redmi 9 power. The quality of camera is not upto mark. I felt even some lower priced and previous versions of redmi gives better camera output. The light from flashlight is lesser than note 5. Power of wifi receiver is very less and i find difficulty in receiving signal when i am not so close to the wifi modem. Even my 2016 model phone picks wifi signals better than redmi power.,3

The 9 power is amazing budget mobile without compromising necessary features. Battery capacity is the most important one ( stands for 2 days for normal usage ) .

The battery performance is ok but phone is slow in performance and lag oftentimes.,3
"I bought it one week ago and it has already started lagging. Sometimes it gets too much heated. Battery is good. There is a privacy issue. If you want to record someone's call, the phone let him know that you are recording. So it is very much problematic. There are lot of things that can't be done in this phone.

My only advice for them who wants to buy this phone is ""don't buy it. It's not worth it.""",2

"I've been using this phone for about 2 months... It's really great but it still needs a little bit improvement in camera, and display...And the battery performance is unbeatable... Front camera is great... And I'm not sure if this fault is only in my phone but WiFi is not connecting properly... Most of the time, WiFi lacks in my phone...
I bought this phone for online classes, and it works well...

"On this budget it is worthy to buy this phone. I have received this phone 3 days back. Too early to give detailed analysis but, so far, I am satisfied. My previous Redmi 7A was also excellent and being a Xiaomi product I am confident that this will prove the same way.",5
To give a proper review I used the product for almost a week now. The Camera and its features are good but can't be compared with high resolution Camera phone. The speed of its processor is satisfying. The screen resolution is okay. The best thing is the screen width. Very big screen which is good and useful in many ways. Overall I am quite satisfied. I would recommend it as a low budget phone in this market.,4
"Superbly great product in this price range. Camera is quite good, not great but good, compensated by great gaming experience... If you are a gamer with low budget, this phone is for you... Smooth, fast, clasic and attractive. Loved it❤",5

Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..,5
As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent 🙂,4

It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!",5
"After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image.

Pros.

INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good.
Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone.

For safety the network will be slow,but ever it is good product and value for money and good for gaming and
Camera perfectly ok, hd display and 64gb rom",5
"Nice very super product and nice performance
Battery backup nice",5
To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway. All I need is good performance and it's working fine after a couple of months. Totally worth your money.👌👌👌,5
"Writing this review after 4 months of purchase - 4gb 128gb varient. :- A value for money product ,but performance wise is a little slow,because of helio G25 processor ,if it had snapdragon processor itt would work much efficiently..camera is below average ,battery backup is amazing.. So if you dont do much of work and if you want it for your parents then its good ,but if you are a student then you can try some other option ...",3

"I've bought this for my parents, overall phone is good. But Redmi has used one camera, atleast they should have used a decent one but no, the camera is below average. My 2 year old Redmi 6 has better camera then this otherwise performance is good. My recommendation is don't go for Realme Narzo 20a, cause the 32 gb fills up immediately and the realme ui is also not as polished as MIUI. You can choose between this and Poco C3.",4

"Mind-blowing purchase

I'm very happy redmi 9 prime very best smartphone and velue for money.
Delivery man behaviour very good man
And flipkart service very good and flipkart family happy family",5
"I've been using this phone for about 2 months... It's really great but it still needs a little bit improvement in camera, and display...And the battery performance is unbeatable... Front camera is great... And I'm not sure if this fault is only in my phone but WiFi is not connecting properly... Most of the time, WiFi lacks in my phone...
I bought this phone for online classes, and it works well...

FYI: If you need a phone for daily use with awesome battery, then you can go with this...

"Very nice phone, performance is excellent,, I see the phone i am quite because it's very good product and good delivery I love this❤❤❤",5
"On this budget it is worthy to buy this phone. I have received this phone 3 days back. Too early to give detailed analysis but, so far, I am satisfied. My previous Redmi 7A was also excellent and being a Xiaomi product I am confident that this will prove the same way.",5
To give a proper review I used the product for almost a week now. The Camera and its features are good but can't be compared with high resolution Camera phone. The speed of its processor is satisfying. The screen resolution is okay. The best thing is the screen width. Very big screen which is good and useful in many ways. Overall I am quite satisfied. I would recommend it as a low budget phone in this market.,4
"Superbly great product in this price range. Camera is quite good, not great but good, compensated by great gaming experience... If you are a gamer with low budget, this phone is for you... Smooth, fast, clasic and attractive. Loved it❤",5
"Good Mobile for gaming, nice display, at this price point it's a good camera 📷 (mega pixels doesn't matter, nice colour production) at this budget its a good Mobile",5

I have been using that phone for 6 months and it is giving very good service..... Thank you Flipkart for this awesome mobile 😊😊....... Friends, you should definitely buy...",5
"Not satisfied with product totally waste of money basically the performance it's not good it doesn't perform well in gaming as well as in battery too
Most probably it doesn't have an option of slow-mo also....The collaboration with Google system in dail log as well as in message is totally disgusting..Older oppo mobiles comes with better performance which I've been using since 2018...Don't buy this product really...you will get better mobiles of another brand in this Price range seriously.",2

Pro's:- * Good display in this price segment but not compete with amoled display.
* Helio G95 performs pretty well ,with 90 hz refresh rate runs smoothly.
* 48 Mp rear sensor satisfies in this price segment, etc

Con's :- * After 1 hour of gaming I found touch issues and some lags ,hope realme fix it in update
* There is no IP rate certification I think so.
* There are lot of heating issues , etc",4

"Such a awesome handset in this segment.
Pro's:- * Good display in this price segment but not compete with amoled display.
* Helio G95 performs pretty well ,with 90 hz refresh rate runs smoothly.
* 48 Mp rear sensor satisfies in this price segment, etc

Con's :- * After 1 hour of gaming I found touch issues and some lags ,hope realme fix it in update
* There is no IP rate certification I think so.
* There are lot of heating issues , etc",4

"Great phone at this price range. Excellent built, great design, G95 performs very well. Little bit warmer while charging but managable. No heating issues while gaming and regular task. Good cameras.

To give a proper review I used the product for almost a week now. The Camera and its features are good but can't be compared with high resolution Camera phone. The speed of its processor is satisfying. The screen resolution is okay. The best thing is the screen width. Very big screen which is good and useful in many ways. Overall I am quite satisfied. I would recommend it as a low budget phone in this market.,4

To be completely honest this is not the best phone out there because there's always a bigger fish but this is the most okay-ish phone in my opinion but i'll give it 5 stars anyway because it works great. It lacks front camera quality and fingerprint sensor but I don't take any pictures and I don't need perfect security anyway.

"Been using this phone for a week now. All features are great; it's light on the hand. Would have preferred a complimentary back silicon cover but oh well it's a good mobile for this price point.
One issue I am having is that: the touch is stretched way too near the edge of the screen; so whenever I'm holding on the edges, the touch seems to misbehave.

Other than that, rest is ok.",5
"Overall it's a good product for daily usage. I bought it for my cousin to facilitate online education and it does the task pretty well. Camera could have been made better but considering the price it does decent job. Multitasking is good, Looks are also stylish and if you're a medium user than this phone won't disappoint you. Battery backup is also good, lasts easily for a day and a half.",5

"If your priority is 5G then blindly go for this.. considering the price realme 8 5G is the cheapest 5G phone and also support lots of 5G bands...otherwise in this price range there are lots of better 4G smartphone available in the market...
Cons
1. Charger is only 18W which is slow in 2021
2. Screen is LCD but quality is good
3.Camera quality is not best.. its avarage
Pros
1.5G future proof with most of the band support
2. The phone tick most of the boxes considering price",3

2. Night camera performance is average. ( Not cons for me but it should be slightly good yet).

I have been using this phone 3 weeks and I played pubg with hd and high graphics I don't get any lag and not much heating 42 to 45 but I think battery should be better because in 4 hours pubg battery drain from 94 to 36 but normal use I get 1.5 day backup and heavy use i get 15 hours because extreme heavy use and other features are normal.,4
"This is a okay mobile.
Cons-the max brightness seems relatively low,
You can't update chrome you have to use the chrome given by infinix which shows a infinix homepage when you open it.
This chrome thing is really bad.
Otherwise the phone is good.",4

Best Phone under 10k. Camera is one of the main highlight compared to other phones in this segment. You have to use both hands to handle this device since the screen size is on higher side. No cons in this price point.,5

"Not so good. previously I used INFINIX NORE 5, a far more better fone than this. Camera is said to be 48 MP, but its an eye wash. Camera is very bad, Front camera is just like 2MP era. Battery is much hyped, NOTE 5 battery was 4000mah and went far long than this one's so called 6000mah. So dont go for this mobile, you will be frustrated.",1

"I have Purchased This Phone In the first sale of infinix hot 10s , i have purchased it at the price point of 9500rs
and the mobile phone is awesome to be honest performance is too good
but there is a heating issue in this device while playing games and some truble in daily to daily task
if i will give the stars according to its performance so

Camera = 8.5/10
Battery= 9/10
performance 8.5/10
display = 8/10 Could be improve
design = 9/10

Best Mobile at this price but there are some cons
